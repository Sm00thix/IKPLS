"""
This file contains an example implementation of cross-validation using the JAX
implementations of IKPLS. It demonstrates how to perform cross-validation with
preprocessing, metric computation, and evaluation.

The code includes the following functions:
- `cross_val_preprocessing`: A function to apply preprocessing to each split of the
    cross-validation.
- `mse_per_component_and_best_components`: A function to compute the mean squared error
    per component and the best number of components.

To run the cross-validation, execute the file.

Note: The code assumes the availability of the `ikpls` package and its dependencies.
