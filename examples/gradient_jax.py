"""
This file demonstrates how to propagate gradients through the IKPLS model using JAX.
It shows how to compute the gradient of the mean squared error between the true and
predicted values with respect to the weights of a convolution filter that is applied
to the X values before a subsequent PLS fit.

The code includes the following functions:
- `apply_1d_convolution`: A function to apply a 1D convolution filter to a matrix.
- `mean_squared_error`: A function to compute the mean squared error between the true
    and predicted values.
- `convolve_fit_mse`: A function to differentiate the mean squared error with respect
    to the weights of the convolution filter.
