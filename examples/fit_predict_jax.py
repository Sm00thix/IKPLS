"""
This script demonstrates the usage of the JAX implementation of IKPLS for fitting and
predicting on data. The script generates random input data and fits the IKPLS model to
the data. It then demonstrates how to make predictions using the fitted model. The
internal model parameters can also be accessed for further analysis.

Note: The script assumes that the 'ikpls' package is installed and accessible.
